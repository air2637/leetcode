## [1616-Split two strings to make palindrome](1616_split-two-strings-to-make-palindrome_test.py)

hint 1: the prefix of s1 should be palindrome of the suffix of s2 from p1 for s1 pointing from left to right, and p2 for s2 pointing from right to left

hint 2: if above breaks, still **need to check the possibility if s2 between p1 and p2 can be self-palindrome

hint 3: the same check needs to be done for prefix of s2 against suffix of s1
